# Data Analysis and Classification: Quality of Streaming Service

In-depth analysis and classification of a dataset that contains an array of parameters used to characterize the quality of a streaming service.

Project completed for the “Data Mining and Machine Learning” exam.




## Short Description

This project focuses on the in-depth analysis of a dataset that contains an array of parameters used to characterize the quality of a streaming service. The dataset itself is divided into three distinct classes, each representing different levels of service quality: NoStall, MildStall, and SevereStall. However, it is worth noting that the dataset exhibits a significant imbalance among these classes. The majority of instances fall into the NoStall category, accounting for approximately 75% of the data, while MildStall makes up about 20%, and SevereStall is represented by less than 5% of the dataset.

The primary goal of this project is to construct a robust model that can effectively analyze the entire dataset. This model will be capable of predicting the Stall level based on a set of entirely new Quality of Service (QoS) parameters provided as input. The utility of these predictions lies in the hands of the service owner, who can leverage them to implement specific and targeted strategies. By doing so, the service owner aims to enhance the user experience, ensuring that viewers enjoy a seamless and uninterrupted streaming service even in the face of potential stalls or disruptions. This proactive approach to quality management is expected to significantly improve user satisfaction and the overall performance of the streaming service.
